3tips
================

3tips is a repository of helpful/interesting things we’ve learned and
would like to highlight/share with others, as well as document for
myself. Inspired by [Thoughtbot’s
TIL](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), I hope to use this medium as a
way to document the little tricks and hacks I pick up along the way.
Topics will involve my areas of interests, which are currently R
programming, Shiny development, and statistical/machine learning
modeling.

## 3tips sessions

*The main motivation behind 3tips is to quickly share knowledge
with the team. As such, the progression of 3tips will be tied to
3tips sessions where we go over three tips and tricks.*
