3tips
================

3tips is a repository of helpful/interesting things I’ve learned and
would like to highlight/share with others, as well as document for
myself. Inspired by [Thoughtbot’s
TIL](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), I hope to use this medium as a
way to document the little tricks and hacks I pick up along the way.
Topics will probably involve my interests, which are currently R
programming, Shiny development, and statistical/machine learning
modeling.

## 3tips sessions

*The main motivation behind 3tips is for me to easily share knowledge
with my co-workers. As such, the progression of 3tips will be tied to
3tips sessions where we go over three tips and tricks.*
